# SoQal

SoQal is a method that allows a learner, in an active learning setting, to dynamically alter its dependence on an oracle for labels. 

This method is described in "SoQal: Selective Oracle Questioning for Consistency-based Active Learning of Cardiac Signals"

# Requirements

The SoQal code requires

* Python 3.6 or higher
* PyTorch 1.0 or higher

# Datasets
